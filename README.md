# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Johnson-Royal

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a business intelligence analyst with a passion for turning messy data into clear insights and meaningful impact.

After years leading retail operations, I transitioned into tech through TripleTen's rigorous BI program — combining my leadership experience with cutting-edge skills in Tableau, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. Now, I use data storytelling to make better business decisions, design dashboards, and guide strategy.
